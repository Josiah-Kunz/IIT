Files added: 
	-> Bx_250_0 and Bz_250_0
		-> These indicate that COSY and G4BL treat fringes differently, 
			but nearly the same.
	-> Mice_Coil_Final
		-> The COSY and G4BL simulations now agree.
		-> Solution was to break CMSTP into 50 mm steps rather than
			a single CMSTP.
		-> Unsure why these two approaches produce different maps.

New business:
do grid -> 1, 10, 100, 1000 sub maps
	-> if not much disc bt 100 and 1000, stop at 100 and play with order
		-> 5, 7, 9, 11 (, 13)
	-> all with g4bl

tilted coil -> make tilted coil element
	-> take a single coil, drift back (to 0 fringe field, say -2m), tilt axis [ta ax ay], 
		propagate through (to, say +2m), drift back to center of coil

- On the whole, the agreement looks great
- At 1 meter, we see the corner particles making their way in
- At around 2 meters, these same four particles start to disagree
- By 4 meters, the COSY corners are at a much larger radius and agreement is lost
- At 10 meters, all particles agree except for the four corners 
	-I'm not sure where the COSY corners went

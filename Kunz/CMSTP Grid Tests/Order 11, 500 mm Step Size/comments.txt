- After a couple of meters, the agreement looks similar to the 100 mm step size
- At 3 meters the disagreement visibly starts to arise
- At 6 meters both the central particles and mid-range particles show great disagreement
- Surprisingly, at 10 meters there is much agreement, except for the outer particles
	- The agreement is still OK, but 100 mm step size is significantly better

- Excellent agreement until 6 meters
	- The corners (I assume) begin to disagree here
- By 8 meters, it looks like the COSY corners fly off, leaving the G4BL corners
- 10 meters shows the beginning of other large |r| disagreement, but otherwise looks good
- These results are not significantly better than the 100 mm step size

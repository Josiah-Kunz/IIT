\Section{Muon-based Accelerators} \par
Muons ($\mu$) were first discovered experimentally in 1947 by Powell \emph{et al.} \cite{griffithspp} who were looking for the Yukawa meson.
It is now known that muons in fact fit into a fundamental particle group called leptons, and fit into the standard model as shown in Figure 1.

\begin{figure}[h!]

Similar to the electron ($e$), the muon carries a fundamental charge of $\pm$1, a spin of 1/2, and observes the electromagnetic and weak forces. Moreover, the muon also has a corresponding neutrino: the muon neutrino ($\nu_\mu$). However, the muon (mass = 105.7 MeV/$c^2$) is about 200 times heavier than the electron (mass = 0.511 MeV/$c^2$). Indeed, sometimes it is useful to think of a muon simply as a heavy electron, but the mass implies several unique characteristics. One of these are the instability of muons, since the following process is not forbidden by mass, charge, or lepton number conservation:
\begin{equation} \nonumber
\mu \rightarrow e+\bar{\nu}_e+\nu_\mu.\\
\end{equation}

This is quite interesting, as it means muons are a double-edged sword. On the one hand, their fundamentality means that the muon collisions will be clean. That is to say, muon colliders have a great advantage over, e.g., proton colliders since protons are composed of three quarks. Each quark may have a different flavor or energy level and hence adds more variables to the analsis. Furthermore, each quark is bound and so gluon interactions must also be considered. These quarks and gluons may undergo hadronization when interacting with one another, creating a plethora of possible hadrons. Hadronization is not fully understood, and so these sprays of hadrons are typically lumped together as a single ``jet". While there are many working models for jet analysis, none are exact. Conversely, any data from muon interactions will have relatively little noise and will not produce jets.

Clean collisions can also be achieved with linear electron colliders. Yet unlike the electron, the muon does not emit a large amount of synchrotron radiation as it is accelerated. This is because the power irradiated off a particle due to syncrotron radiation is $\propto 1/m^4$ \cite{griffithsem}. Therefore, the relative power loss due to synchrotron radiation for electrons and muons is $P_e/P_\mu\propto m_\mu ^4/m_e ^4 \approx 1.8 \text{\sc{e}}9$. For this reason, it is possible to have a circular muon accelerator. Furthermore, due to the small mass of a muon compared to a proton ($\sim$105 MeV/$c^2$ vs $\sim$938 MeV/$c^2$), muons will be easier to accelerate. This means that a muon facility will be much smaller than its proton counterpart. 

However, there is one problem for a muon accelerator. A rest frame lifetime of 2 $\mu$s requires the muons to be accelerated quickly before they decay. This is a challenge for circular colliders which require a high-intensity beam.

Overall, it appears that there are several advantages and one key disadvantage: the 2 $\mu$s mean rest frame lifetime of the muon. However, this is only a disadvantage for muon colliders. Another application which turns the moderately short lifetime into an advantage is a neutrino factory. This is a facility which is dedicated to the output of a neutrino beam. Muons have two primary advantages over fission reactor neutrino sources. The first is that muons decay into exactly two flavors of neutrino: electron and muon. Therefore, the initial composition of the neutrino beam would be roughly known. This is important since neutrinos can change their flavors over time. Secondly, since neutrinos have no electric charge, they cannot be manipulated via electromagnetic focusing methods. However, the beam of muons can be focused into a high-intensity beam, and the intensity of the neutrino beam will reflect this.

\Section{COSY Infinity}\par
COSY Infinity is a beamline simulations tool used in the design, analysis, and optomization of particle accelerators \cite{cosy}. COSY uses the transfer map approach, which evaluates the overall effect of a system on a beam of particles using differential algebra. This involves phase space vectors being expanded into multivariate Taylor polynomials up to arbitrary order \cite{modernMapMethods}. An example of a phase space vector can be seen in Equation \ref{eqn:phaseSpaceVector}, where the coordinates are transverse positions ($x, y$), time-of-flight in units of length ($l$), transverse angles w.r.t. the reference particle ($a, b$), and kinetic energy deviations w.r.t. the reference particle ($\delta$). The $0$ subscript in the definitions denotes the reference particle properties. However, any arbitrary ``coordinates'' such as spin would also work in principle.

\begin{equation}
\centering
\mathbf{Z}=
\begin{pmatrix}
x\\ y\\ l=k(t-t_0)\\a=p_x/p_0\\b=p_y/p_0\\  \delta = (E-E_0)/E_0
\end{pmatrix}
%\caption[Phase space vector $\mathbf{Z}$.]{Phase space vector $\mathbf{Z}$. Coordinates are transverse positions ($x, y$), time-of-flight in units of length ($l$), transverse angles w.r.t. the reference particle ($a, b$), and kinetic energy deviations w.r.t. the reference particle ($\delta$). The $0$ subscript in the definitions denotes the reference particle's properties.}
\label{eqn:phaseSpaceVector}
\end{equation}

In beam physics, phase space vectors $\mathbf{Z}$ are subject to physical processes. This subjugation can usually be represented by a differential equation. For example, a particle in an electric field is subject to the force law \cite{griffithsem}
\begin{align}\nonumber
\mathbf{F}&=Q(\mathbf{E}+\mathbf{v}\times \mathbf{B}),
\end{align}
or using Maxwell's equations
\begin{align}\nonumber
\frac{d}{dt}\mathbf{p}&=Q(\mathbf{E}+\frac{1}{m}\mathbf{p}\times \mathbf{B}).
\end{align}
This is only the equation for the momentum-dependent components of the aforementioned $\mathbf{Z}$, $a$ and $b$. However, the explicit dependence is easily worked out.

Fortunately, any phase space vector $\mathbf{Z}$ in an arbitrarily-ordered ordinary differential equation (ODE) can be rewritten as a first-order ODE \cite{modernMapMethods}. For an order $n$ ODE, a first-order ODE is constructed by introducing $n-1$ new variables. This is to say that
\begin{align} \nonumber
\frac{d^n}{ds^n}\mathbf{Z}&=\mathbf{f}(\frac{d^0}{ds^0}\mathbf{Z},...,\frac{d^{n-1}}{ds^{n-1}}\mathbf{Z})
\end{align}
can be rewritten as
\begin{align} \nonumber
\frac{d}{ds} \begin{pmatrix}
		\mathbf{Z} \\ \mathbf{Z}_1 \\ \vdots \\ \mathbf{Z}_{n-1}
		\end{pmatrix}
&= 		\begin{pmatrix}
		\mathbf{Z}_1 \\ \mathbf{Z}_2 \\ \vdots \\ \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{Z},...,\mathbf{Z}_{n-1})
		\end{pmatrix}.
\end{align}
Here, $\mathbf{f}$ represents the real physics processes. For the Maxwell's equations example, the equation is first-order already with the momentum component of $\mathbf{f}$ as
\begin{align}\nonumber
\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{p})=Q(\mathbf{E}+\frac{1}{m}\mathbf{p}\times\mathbf{B}).
\end{align}
 Furthermore, the independent variable in principle does not matter. COSY does not use time, but rather arc length $s$ (see Figure \ref{fig:saxis})).

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics*[width=70mm]{./Figures/saxis}
\caption{The reference orbit. Figure courtesy of \cite{berzFullnotes}.}
\label{fig:saxis}
\end{figure}

Now that there is a system of equations, the transfer map $\mathcal{M}$ will uniquely predict the evolution of $\mathbf{Z}$. This is because most beam elements follow differential equations which yield unique solutions dependent on initial conditions (such as Maxwell's equations). Mathematically, this relationship is $\mathbf{Z}(s)=\mathcal{M}(s_0 , s)*\mathbf{Z}(s_0)$, with the $*$ representing the composition of functions. An example of this relationship can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:matrix_element_example_1}. The initial phase space occupied by the beam of particles is at the coordinate $s_0$. Physically, there exists some deterministic beamline element. This element can be represented by the map $\mathcal{M}$, which creates a bijection for the phase space vectors $\mathbf{Z}(s_0)$ and $\mathbf{Z}(s)$ between the initial coordinate $s_0$ and an arbitrary final coordinate $s$. 

Entire lattices may also be represented by a single transfer map. This is done by dividing the lattice into its base components or elements. A transfer map for each corresponding element may then be produced. For two example elements between coordinates $s_0$ and $s_2$ (see Figure \ref{fig:matrix_element_example_2}), the composition of two maps yeilds another map: $\mathcal{M}(s_1 , s_2)\times \mathcal{M}(s_0 , s_1) = \mathcal{M}(s_0 , s_2)$.  Therefore, it is possible to ``cut out'' the middle part $s_1$. In this way, the transfer maps from small components build up into a single transfer map for the whole system. Computationally this is advantageous because once calculated, it is much faster to apply a single transfer map to a distribution of particles than to simulate that same distribution through many meters of individual lattice elements.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{Figures/matrix_element_example_1}

  \label{fig:matrix_element_example_2}
\end{figure}

While a transfer map is technically not a nonlinear matrix, it is sometimes helpful to think of them as one in the same. Along with the evaluation of particles through a lattice, COSY also has a plethora of analysis and optomization tools, including (but not limited to) lattice aberration and correction tools, support for Twiss parameters, support for tunes and nonlinear tune shifts, built-in optimizers (for lattice design), and spin tracking.

Valid elements are any beamline tools which are deterministic. Elements used in this study are magnetic multipoles (dipoles, quadrupoles, etc.), solenoidal coils, RF cavities, and drifts. Currently supported elements in COSY include but are not limited to: various magnetic and electric multipoles (with fringe effects), homogeneous and inhomogeneous bending elements, Wien filters, wigglers and undulators, cavities, cylindrical electromagnetic lenses, general particle optical elements, and deterministic polynomial absorbers of arbitrary order, with the last element being of particular interest.

\Subsection{Emittance}
Often, it is advantageous to represent the volume of phase space occupied by the beam by the emittance, $\epsilon$. It is sometimes beneficial to normalize the emittance by the relativistic factors, $\gamma$ and $\beta$. This is useful because when a beam accelerates the transverse angles decrease. This results in a  reduction of $\epsilon_x$ (where $x$ represents the general transverse direction) even though nothing was done to the transverse phase space directly. However, $\epsilon_x ^N$ stays constant when a beam accelerates. For the relevant transverse emittance,
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:emittancedef}
%\epsilon_x^N=\beta\gamma\epsilon_x=\beta \gamma\sigma_x \sigma_\theta.
\epsilon_x^N=\beta\gamma\epsilon_x=\beta\gamma\sqrt{\left<x^2\right>\left<\theta^2\right>-\left<x\theta\right>^2}.
\end{equation}
%
Here, azimuthal symmetry is assumed, and so $x$ represents the general transverse position, and $\theta =\sin^{-1} p_x/p$ is the projection of the divergence angle of the particle trajectory onto the $x$-$z$ plane, where $z$ is the longitudinal Cartesian coordinate. 

The full derivation of emittance can be found in Appendix \ref{apx:emittance}. It is assumed that the beam in nearly Gaussian in both $x$ and $\theta$. Qualitatively, if there exists no cross-dependence in $x$ and $\theta$, then the distribution should be an non-tilted ellipse. Then the volume of this bivariate Gaussian is proportional to the geometric mean, $\sqrt{\left<x^2\right>\left<\theta^2\right>}$. However, if there is some cross-dependence then the result is a tilted ellipse. For a sample comparison of tilted vs. non-tilted ellipses, observe Figure \ref{fig:ellipses}. Here, the emittance is outlined in red.

\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}

  \caption[$x$-$\theta$ phase space examples.]{$x$-$\theta$ phase space examples. Left: example beam with no $x$-$\theta$ correlation ($\left<x\theta\right>=0$). Right: example beam with significant $x$-$\theta$ correlation ($\left<x\theta\right>=0.8$).}
  \label{fig:ellipses}
 \end{center}
\end{figure}

Now it is possible to derive the effect of cooling absorbers on emittance as it pertains to muon ionization cooling. Closely following \cite{Fernow}, Eqn. \ref{eqn:emittancedef} is differentiated by $z$:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:emittance1}
\frac{d\epsilon_x^N}{dz}=\epsilon_x \frac{d(\beta\gamma)}{dz}+\beta\gamma\frac{d\epsilon_x}{dz},
\end{equation}
%
It will soon be shown that the first term represents `cooling' and the second term represents `heating' in the transverse plane. Starting with the heating term,
%
\begin{equation} \nonumber
\frac{d\epsilon_x^N}{dz}(heat)=\beta\gamma\frac{d\epsilon_x}{dz}.
\end{equation}
%

It can be assumed that the cooling is taking place near the beam waist (that is, the part of the trajectory where the beam spread is smallest). For this case, it is a reasonable approximation that the transverse phase space has little $x-\theta$ cross-dependence, and so the $\left<x\theta\right>$ term may be neglected. Furthermore, with strong focusing it is possible to neglect the rate of position growth of the beam. This is cited in \cite{Fernow} provided the conditions that $\sigma_{xo}^2 \gg \theta_c^2 L / 2\omega^2$ and $\sigma_{xo}^2 \gg \theta_c^2 / 4\omega^3$, where $L$ is the absorber length, $\omega$ is the focusing strength parameter, $\sigma_{xo}$ is the original beam size incident upon the absorber, and $\theta_c$ is the coefficient of the RMS scattering angle given in \cite{highland}. Using these two approximations, the only derivative in the heating term is that of $\left<\theta^2\right>$:
\begin{equation} \nonumber
\frac{d\epsilon_x^N}{dz}(heat)\approx\beta\gamma\frac{d}{dz}\sqrt{\left<x^2\right>\left<\theta^2\right>}\approx \frac{\beta\gamma}{2\epsilon_x}\left<x^2\right>\frac{d}{dz}\left<\theta^2\right>.
\end{equation}

From betatron focusing theory, $\left<x^2\right>$ may be rewritten as $\beta_\perp \epsilon_x$. Moreover, using \cite{highland} $\left<\theta^2\right>$ can be written as $h(z)/\beta^2E$. Here, $h(z)$ is the Highland $z$-dependence, the form of which many theories disagree. However, the first order term of $h(z)$ is generally not model-dependent, and so this becomes
\begin{equation} \nonumber
\left<\theta^2\right>\approx\frac{E_s}{\beta^2 E}\sqrt{\frac{z}{X_0}},
\end{equation}
where $E_s$ is some characteristic energy ($\approx14$ $MeV$) and $X_0$ is the radiation length of the given material. Then
\begin{equation} \nonumber
\frac{d\epsilon_x^N}{dz}(heat)\approx\beta\gamma\frac{\beta_\perp}{2}\frac{d}{dz}\big(\frac{E_s}{\beta^2 E}\sqrt{\frac{z}{X_0}}\big),
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:emittanceheat}
\frac{d\epsilon_x^N}{dz}(heat)\approx\frac{\beta_\perp}{2}\frac{E_s^2}{\beta^3Emc^2}\frac{1}{X_0}.
\end{equation}

Now it is clearer why this is referred to as the heating term. Since the derivative of emittance is positive, this part represents emittance growth. Moreover, to reduce this growth it is necessary to have highly energetic particles through a material with a large radiation length (typically $X_0 \propto 1/Z$ (nuclear charge)).

Observe the cooling term of Eqn. \ref{eqn:emittance1}:
\begin{equation} \nonumber
\frac{d\epsilon_x^N}{dz}(cool)=\epsilon_x\frac{d(\beta\gamma)}{dz}=\epsilon_x\cdot(\beta\frac{d\gamma}{dz}+\gamma\frac{d\beta}{dz}).
\end{equation}
First,
\begin{equation} \nonumber
\frac{d\beta}{dz}=\frac{d}{dz}(1-\gamma^{-2})^{\frac{1}{2}}=\frac{1}{\beta\gamma^3}\frac{d\gamma}{dz},
\end{equation}
and then,
\begin{equation} \nonumber
\frac{d\gamma}{dz}=\frac{\gamma}{E}\frac{dE}{dz},
\end{equation}
with $E$ as the total energy of the muon beam. Finally,
\begin{equation} \nonumber
\frac{d\epsilon_x^N}{dz}(cool)=\epsilon_x\cdot(\beta\frac{d\gamma}{dz}+\gamma\frac{1}{\beta\gamma^3}\frac{d\gamma}{dz})=\epsilon_x\cdot\frac{d\gamma}{dz}\beta(1+\frac{1}{\beta^2\gamma^2}) \vspace*{12pt}
\frac{d\epsilon_x^N}{dz}(cool)=\epsilon_x\frac{dE}{dz}\frac{\gamma}{E\beta}.
\end{equation}
Normalizing the emittance by first multiplying and then dividing by $\beta\gamma$ results in
\begin{equation} \nonumber
\frac{d\epsilon_x^N}{dz}(cool)=\frac{1}{\beta}\frac{dE}{dz}\frac{\epsilon_x^N}{E}
\end{equation}
However, there are two corrections which should be observed. First, even for a perfect monoenergetic beam energy loss is stochastic, not deterministic. Two muons with identical initial conditions will likely lose different amounts of energy as they pass through the same medium. Since emittance is a collective effect, is it more appropriate to talk about an average energy loss, which turns $\frac{dE}{dz}$ into $\left<\frac{dE}{dz}\right>$. The second observation is with regard to sign convention. Typically, one refers to energy loss as a positive quantity (e.g. the beam lost 10 MeV from point A to point B), even though it is clear that $\frac{dE}{dz}$ is negative. For this reason, the energy loss term must again be changed from $\left<\frac{dE}{dz}\right>$ to  $-\left|\left<\frac{dE}{dz}\right>\right|$. This leaves the full cooling term as
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:emittancecool}
\frac{d\epsilon_x^N}{dz}(cool)=-\frac{1}{\beta}\left| \left<\frac{dE}{dz}\right>\right| \frac{\epsilon_x^N}{E}.
\end{equation}

Similar to the heating term, it is now understandable why this is referred to as the cooling term. The rate of change of the normalized transverse emittance is negative, and so the transverse phase space shrinks. However, at this point Eqn. \ref{eqn:emittancecool} does not explain precisely how the rate changes, and so is purely conceptual. The shape of the cooling term is determined by the average energy loss, $\left|\left<\frac{dE}{dz}\right>\right|$. However, usually it is not $\left|\left<\frac{dE}{dz}\right>\right|$ that is measured, but rather the stopping power $S(E)=-\frac{1}{\rho}\left<\frac{dE}{dx}\right>$, typically in units of MeV cm$^2$/g. A good example of a stopping power curve can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:bethecurve} \cite{PDG}. For this example, there are several effects noted in Figure \ref{fig:bethecurve}, and one may be tempted to think that based on \ref{eqn:emittancecool} the most cooling should occur in the Anderson-Ziegler regime at $\beta\gamma\sim0.01$ (since there is a $1/E$ dependence in Eqn. \ref{eqn:emittancecool}, the high energy part of the curve does no good). Indeed, for $\rho= 8.92$ g/cm$^3$ it is easy to see that at $\beta\gamma=0.01$ then $\frac{d\epsilon_x^N}{dz}(cool)\approx-900$  cm$^{-1} \cdot \epsilon_x^N.$

However, the correct strategy is just the opposite---one should endeavor to build a cooling cell with the minimum ionization point in mind (in the Bethe regime, where $\beta\gamma\sim2$). At the peak ($\beta\gamma\sim0.01$), the muon beam slows down quite a bit through a single cooling cell and one is at risk of losing their beam to decay. Moreover, Figure \ref{fig:bethecurve} only depicts the stopping power, not the actual energy loss that individual particles experience. The individual energy loss is a stochastic effect, and the distribution of energy losses broadens with decreasing beam energy. This means that for lower energies, there will be more particles which stop completely. Further, with a higher beam energy the stochastic energy loss profile is more sharply peaked, and so there are fewer decays and more particles which are in the RF stability region. (Remember, the longitidunal emittance is observed by the RF cavities, as seen in Figure \ref{fig:coolingchannel}. The longitudinal emittance increases with energy loss according to \cite{Fernow}.) Finally, Eqn. \ref{eqn:emittanceheat} suggests that higher energies are better, since they reduce the heating term. For these reasons, it is apparent that a muon cooling cell should be made of low $Z$ materials such as liquid hydrogen or lithium hydride and operate anywhere between 100 MeV/$c$ to 400 MeV$/c$.

\end{figure}

When particles impinge upon a fixed target, they lose some of their energy. For massive particles like muons, there are a number of major effects that contribute. However, it is important to note that in the muon cooling regime only ionization contributes significantly to the energy loss. To see this, take for an example the relatively heavy element of iron (iron is chosen because it is a fairly relatable element to those who are not experts in this field). In Table \ref{tbl:elossfe}, the energy loss contributions of these four effects can be seen. However, the non-ionization effects only start to contribute at an initial beam kinetic energy of 1.40 GeV---far outside of the muon cooling regime.

This is a good example because all of the cooling materials currently being considered have less muon stopping power than iron. This means that iron represents the maximum contribution of non-ionization energy loss per initial beam energy; that is, the non-ionization effects begin to emerge at much higher energies for lighter materials such as liquid hydrogen. Note that Figure \ref{fig:bethecurve} may also be useful when discussing this subject, as the minimum ionization regime is explicitly characterized.

Here, \textit{ionization} refers to both true ionization (the production of $\delta$ rays) and excitation (the promotion of an inner electron to a higher shell). To reiterate the previous section, the term `straggling' refers to the fluctuation about some mean energy loss. That is to say, the amount of energy that a particle will lose is intrinsically random---there exists some distribution with some average value, and when the particle of interest transverses a length of matter the amount of energy that this particle loses is selected from this distribution. This intrinsic randomness can be attributed to quantum-like behaviors (e.g. the energy loss cross section which comes from the wave nature of the particle in question).

\Section{Introduction to Matter-Dominated Lattices}\par

\Subsection{Introduction to Stochastic Effects}
This section introduces stochastic effects, or effects that are intrinsically random. These effects are in contrast to deterministic effects, which are not random and hence can be predicted exactly. 

This work is concerned with the interactions between a muon beam and some stationary target called the `absorber'---typically a cylinder or wedge of a low-z material such as liquid hydrogen or lithium hydride. The simplest model of a beam interacting with some stationary target can be found in several textbooks \cite{nielsen,griffithsqm}, but perhaps the most helpful model comes from \cite{jose} in Figure \ref{fig:scatteringmodel}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/scattering_model} 

  \caption{Classical muon--target interaction model courtesy of \cite{jose}.}
  \label{fig:scatteringmodel}
\end{figure}

In this figure $b$ is referred to as the impact parameter and is measured with respect to the particle's initial trajectory. For a beam of noninteracting particles and a perfectly stationary target, classical mechanics suggest that this is a purely deterministic problem (see, e.g., `hard-sphere scattering' in \cite{griffithsqm}); the particle with a smaller impact parameter $b$ will deflect more than its neighbor with a slightly larger impact parameter of $b+db$. This model is entirely based on initial conditions, and if this were reality it would be relatively easy to implement these effects into the map methods of COSY Infinity. However, reality does not follow the model of Figure \ref{fig:scatteringmodel}. A more accurate model is illustrated by Figure \ref{fig:scatteringmodel2}. Here the target is still approximated as fixed, but the incident particle is now approximated as a travelling plane wave and the scattered particle is approximated as a spherical wave (at least locally).
\begin{figure}
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/scattering_model_2} 
  \caption[Quantum muon--target interaction model.]{Quantum muon--target interaction model. The incoming particle wavefunction is represented as a plane wave and is scattered locally as a spherical wave. Image courtesy of \cite{griffithsqm}.}
  \label{fig:scatteringmodel2}
\end{figure}
It will be shown later that this model predicts 
\begin{enumerate}
\item a spectrum of energy loss $\omega(\epsilon)$ which yields the probability of losing an amount of energy $\epsilon$ (see Section \ref{sec:ICOOLStraggling}), and
\item a scattering amplitude which gives the shape of the probability distribution of scattering in a given direction $\theta$ (see Section \ref{sec:ICOOLScattering}).
\end{enumerate}
Hence quantum theory suggests that even if two identical particles have identical initial conditions their final conditions will not be the same.

In Section 1.1, the primary disadvantage to the considered muon-based accelerator was the mean muon rest frame lifetime (2 $\mu$s). This is expected to be far too short of a timespan to be useful in a traditional accelerator scheme. For the moment, observe the two proposed schematics in Figure \ref{fig:muon_accelerator_schematic}\cite{map}. The section labelled `Proton Driver' produces protons, which will eventually yield muons. This is essential since muons do not naturally occur in great quantities at a convenient extraction point. To do this, the protons strike some large target (which must be optimized to produce the highest yield), resulting in a spray of protons, muons, electrons, and pions (even shorter-lived particles consisting of a quark-antiquark pair). To further optimize this process, it is advantageous to let the pions decay into muons via $\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ + \nu_\mu$. The resulting ensemble of muons is then split up into bunches. The next section is where all of the interesting physics lies, and is the focus of this thesis. For now, it will be simply addressed as the `cooling channel' and delved into later. Cooling the beam simply means to reducing the beam's phase space. Reducing the momenta of the beam will result in a reduced physical size. The purpose of cooling is to increase the density of the resulting beam. This lets the beam fit into smaller magnets, which are less expensive than larger magnets. However, this increase in density also increases the luminosity of the beam in the long run. For a collider, this means more collisions; for a neutrino factory, this means more neutrino counts in the detectors (since neutrinos are neutral, the $\nu$ beam would disperse too early). After this critical step, the beam accelerates to an appropriate energy. For a neutrino factory, this is 5 GeV, and the muon and antimuon beams are allowed to decay in a storage ring. For a muon collider, the center-of-momentum energy is $\sim 126$ GeV for a Higgs factory or up to 10 TeV for high energy studies.

The cooling channel is the crux of the entire operation for either purpose. Traditional cooling methods (e.g. FODO, electron cooling, etc.) are expected to take far too long to allow a significant portion of the muon beam to survive.

For example, for 1 TeV muons the mean muon lifetime in the lab frame is $\bar{t'}=2.2\,\mu$s $\cdot$ 1 TeV/105.7 MeV $\approx 0.02$ s.

However, ionization cooling is a much faster method. Ionization cooling requires the beam to deposit its energy in matter, thus ionizing the matter.

While the idea of ionization cooling has been around since at least 1956 \cite{oneill,lichtenberg}, it did not appear to be a viable option until roughly 1970 \cite{YuM}. It was believed that the multiple scattering effect would mask any cooling benefits. Scattering is a quantum effect which deflects two objects when they are in close proximity at high energies, and hence is intrinsically random. This means that while the energy deposition reduced the beam's phase space, the beam would also grow in the transverse direction due to this multiple scattering.

Now, this seems to be quite the opposite of what is intended; ionization cooling potentially produces a slow, fat beam, and a good muon beam should be narrow and fast so that the Lorentz boost keeps the muons from decaying. Fortunately, there exists a schematic that solves both of these problems simultaneously. Physically, it is represented in  Figure \ref{fig:coolingchannel} and it is vectorally depicted in Figure \ref{fig:123ionization}.

 \end{center}
\end{figure}

The key is to use a cell which contains both the ionizing material and a radio frequency cavity. It is clear why this solves the latter problem: after the beam loses energy, it gains that much energy again, and so the Lorentz boost stays constant on average. However, to understand why this solves the former problem it is necessary to observe Figure \ref{fig:123ionization}. In Figure \ref{fig:123ionization}, the longitudinal momentum ($p_l$) is plotted against the transverse momentum ($p_t$). 
   \begin{enumerate} 
  \item{Beam deposits energy in material, reducing the momentum in all directions.}
  \item{Multiple scattering effects are observed. The transverse phase space increases (or `heats up'). }
  \item{The beam is re-accelerated by the RF cavity, increasing the longitudinal momentum only. The result is a reduction in transverse momentum (i.e. blue vector compared to black vector).}
\end{enumerate}

\Section{Looking Forward}\par

In short, this work endeavors to take these and other basic principles to successfully implement muon ionization cooling simulation tools into COSY Infinity. The routines which will be implemented are derived from first or second principles as will be seen from other codes in Chapter \ref{chp:other_codes} and novelly in Chapter \ref{chp:cosy}. Furthermore, these routines will augmented by fitting the results to experimental data and benchmarked against external sources. The results of benchmarking and validation will be discussed in Chapter \label{chp:results}. Here, it will be seen that the new routines in COSY produce robust, accurate, and fast simulations.
